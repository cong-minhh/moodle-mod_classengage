## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Plugin Installation Issues

**Problem:** Plugin not detected

```bash
# Check file structure
ls -la mod/classengage/version.php

# Check permissions
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data mod/classengage
sudo chmod -R 755 mod/classengage

# Clear Moodle cache
php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
```

**Problem:** Database errors

```bash
# Check database connection
php admin/cli/check_database_schema.php

# Manually run install
mysql -u moodle_user -p moodle_db < mod/classengage/db/install.xml
```

### NLP Service Issues

**Problem:** Connection failed

```
Error: NLP service connection failed
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify NLP service is running (see separate repo)
2. Check endpoint URL in Moodle settings
3. Test service: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
4. Check firewall rules if on different server

For NLP service troubleshooting, see:  
👉 https://github.com/cong-minhh/classengage-nlp-service

### File Upload Issues

**Problem:** Upload fails

```bash
# Check PHP limits
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize
php -i | grep post_max_size

# Check Moodle limits
# Site Administration → Security → Site policies → Maximum uploaded file size

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### AJAX/Real-time Issues

**Problem:** Updates not working

```
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify polling is enabled in settings
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Check $CFG->wwwroot in config.php
5. Disable browser extensions temporarily
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow quiz sessions

```bash
# Increase polling interval
# Site Administration → Plugins → ClassEngage
# Set Polling Interval: 2000 (or higher)

# Enable Moodle caching
# Site Administration → Plugins → Caching

# Check server resources

htop

## Installation

### Standard Plugin Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract it to `mod/classengage` in your Moodle installation.
2. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator.
3. Go to **Site administration > Notifications** to trigger the database update.
4. Configure the AI provider settings in **Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > In-class Learning Engagement**.

### Runtime Compatibility

ClassEngage is compatible with both:

- **Standard Moodle deployments** running directly on a VM or bare-metal host
- **Dockerized Moodle deployments** using either a custom Moodle image or sidecar worker/cron containers

Docker is optional. The plugin works anywhere the runtime that executes background tasks provides the required capabilities.

### Required Runtime Capabilities

For the current NLP pipeline:

- Moodle cron must run reliably
- PHP CLI must be able to bootstrap the same Moodle installation as the web runtime
- `shell_exec` must be enabled for the task runner
- `pdftotext` is required for PDF text extraction
- `ZipArchive` is required for PPTX and DOCX processing
- at least one AI provider must be configured

Recommended for better PDF previews and richer inspection:

- `pdfinfo`
- PHP `Imagick`
- ImageMagick policy that allows PDF reads

### Background Processing Model

The current NLP flow is background-first:

- Web requests queue adhoc tasks through [`slides_api.php`](slides_api.php)
- Document inspection runs in [`classes/task/inspect_document_task.php`](classes/task/inspect_document_task.php)
- Question generation runs in [`classes/task/generate_nlp_task.php`](classes/task/generate_nlp_task.php)
- Standard Moodle scheduled tasks remain declared in [`db/tasks.php`](db/tasks.php)

For production use, choose one of these execution models:

1. **Cron only**
   - Run `admin/cli/cron.php` every minute
   - Simpler to operate
   - Slower task pickup
2. **Cron + dedicated worker** (recommended)
   - Keep Moodle cron enabled
   - Also run `mod/classengage/classes/task/task_worker.php`
   - Gives near real-time 2-5 second task pickup for `mod_classengage`

| PDF text not extracted | Missing `pdftotext` in the task runner | Install `poppler-utils` on the server or in the worker/container image |
| Images not processing | ImageMagick blocked | Fix ImageMagick security policy |
| Generation times out | Large PDF or slow API | Reduce image resolution or increase timeout |
| Questions stored with classengageid=0 | Variable bug (v1.0.0) | Update to v1.0.1+ |

### Clicker Integration Setup

To enable physical clicker support (or to use the Web Services API for testing), you must configure Moodle Web Services. Follow these steps **in order**.

> **Note**: This setup is **only required** if you are using physical clicker devices or testing the API directly. Students using the web interface do not need this configuration.

#### Step 1: Enable Web Services Globally

1. Go to **Site Administration > Advanced features**
2. Find **Enable web services** and check the box ☑️
3. Click **Save changes**

#### Step 2: Enable REST Protocol

1. Go to **Site Administration > Server > Web services > Manage protocols**
2. Click the 👁️ eye icon next to **REST protocol** to enable it (the eye should become open/visible)
3. The REST protocol row should now show as enabled

#### Step 3: Create the Service User

1. Go to **Site Administration > Users > Accounts > Add a new user**
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Username**: `clicker_hub` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Password**: Choose a strong password
   - **First name**: `Clicker`
   - **Last name**: `Hub`
   - **Email**: `clicker@example.com` (can be any valid email format)
3. Click **Create user**

#### Step 4: Create a Custom Role (Optional but Recommended)

This step creates a minimal-permission role for security. You can skip this if the user has admin rights.

1. Go to **Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles**
2. Click **Add a new role**
3. Choose **Use role or archetype**: Select "No role" and click **Continue**
4. Fill in:
   - **Short name**: `clickerhub`
   - **Custom full name**: `Clicker Hub Service`
   - **Role archetype**: Leave as "None"
   - **Context types**: Check ☑️ **System**
5. In the **Capabilities** section, search for and allow (set to ✅ Allow):
   - `webservice/rest:use` — Use REST protocol
   - `mod/classengage:view` — View ClassEngage activity
   - `mod/classengage:takequiz` — Take quiz (submit responses)
   - `mod/classengage:submitclicker` — Submit clicker responses
6. Click **Create this role**

#### Step 5: Assign the Role to the Service User

1. Go to **Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Assign system roles**
2. Click on **Clicker Hub Service** (the role you just created)
3. Find `clicker_hub` in the "Potential users" list and add them to "Existing users"
4. Click **Add** to assign the role

#### Step 6: Enable the ClassEngage External Service

1. Go to **Site Administration > Server > Web services > External services**
2. Find **ClassEngage Clicker Service** in the list
3. If the "Enabled" column shows ❌ or is unchecked:
   - Click on the service name to edit it
   - Check ☑️ **Enabled**
   - Click **Save changes**
4. Click on the service name **ClassEngage Clicker Service**
5. Scroll down to **Authorised users**
6. Click **Add** and select the `clicker_hub` user
7. Click **Add** to authorize this user

#### Step 7: Generate an API Token

1. Go to **Site Administration > Server > Web services > Manage tokens**
2. Click **Create token** (or **Add**)
3. Fill in:
   - **User**: Search for and select `clicker_hub`
   - **Service**: Select **ClassEngage Clicker Service**
   - **Valid until**: Leave empty for no expiration, or set a date
   - **IP restriction**: Leave empty (or restrict to specific IPs for security)
4. Click **Save changes**
5. **Copy the generated token** — you will need this for your clicker hub software or API testing

   > ⚠️ **Important**: The token is only shown once! Copy it immediately and store it securely.

#### Step 8: Verify the Setup

Test that your token works by running this command (replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual token):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/webservice/rest/server.php" \
  -d "wstoken=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d "wsfunction=core_webservice_get_site_info" \
  -d "moodlewsrestformat=json"
```

**Expected response** (success):

```json
{"sitename":"Your Moodle Site","username":"clicker_hub",...}
```

**If you get an error**, see the troubleshooting section below.

## Usage Workflow

### Standard Workflow

1. **Upload**: Instructor uploads lecture slides to the activity.
2. **Generate**: System generates questions; Instructor reviews and approves them.
3. **Engage**: Instructor starts a live session; Students join and answer questions via web or clickers.
4. **Analyze**: Instructor reviews the analytics dashboard to adjust future teaching strategies.

### Clicker Workflow

1. **Setup**: Teacher starts the session in Moodle.
2. **Poll**: The classroom hub polls the API for the active session and current question.
3. **Submit**: Students press buttons on their clickers; the hub collects responses and submits them in bulk to Moodle.
4. **Result**: Grades are automatically synced to the Moodle gradebook.

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests

**PHPUnit Tests:**

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit mod/classengage/tests/
```

# 5. Cleanup
php mod/classengage/tests/load_test_api.php -a cleanup -p scaletest
```

**NFR Compliance Checks:**
The `concurrent` action automatically validates:

- **NFR-01**: Sub-1-second average response latency
- **NFR-03**: 95%+ success rate with 200+ concurrent users

**Performance Metrics:**
The script reports latency statistics (min, avg, P50, P95, P99, max), throughput (responses/second), and error summaries.

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Modules

The quiz interface uses a modular JavaScript architecture:

- **quiz.js**: Main quiz participation module with offline support and optimistic UI updates
- **controlpanel.js**: Instructor control panel with real-time student monitoring and session control
- **connection_manager.js**: Handles SSE connections with automatic polling fallback
- **client_cache.js**: IndexedDB-based offline response caching with automatic retry

### Connection Handling

The plugin uses a tiered approach for real-time communication:

1. **Primary**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for low-latency server-to-client push
2. **Fallback**: HTTP polling at configurable intervals when SSE is unavailable
3. **Offline**: IndexedDB caching with automatic sync on reconnection

### Performance Targets

- Response acknowledgment: <1 second latency
- Question broadcast: <500ms to all connected clients
- Concurrent users: 200+ per session
- Offline cache: Unlimited pending responses with automatic retry
